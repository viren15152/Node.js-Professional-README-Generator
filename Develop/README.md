## Description

A command-line/terminal application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a users input that uses the inquirer 8.2.4 package. When you create an open source project it is vital to include a high quality README.md with information about the application. This is strictly a command-line node.js application that is designed specifically for github hosted projects.
